# config
#### Version 1.3

lisdir-with-hashes is a python module that can list the files, sha1 and md5 in a csv file of a recursive directory path. It also compresses the output csv file into a zip file. 


## New Features: 
* Still supports the command line arguments for the value of the input directory and output file
* Added config.ini file


### Machine Problem

* Modify your work on Machine Problem "listdir with hashes" and create a config file for it
* The config file should contain the input directory and the output file
* Your application should still support the command line arguments for the value of the input directory and output file
* If the command line argument is present, use its value instead of the value in the config file. If its not present, use the value of the config file
* Commit your work in GitHub to a new branch named "config". Paste the link of the branch here.
